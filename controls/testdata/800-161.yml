  title: Access Control
  description: "Systems and components that traverse the supply chain are subject to access by a variety of individuals and enterprises... Such access should be defined and managed to ensure that it does not inadvertently result in the unauthorized release, modification, or destruction of information."
  guidelines:
    - id: AC-5
      title: Separation of Duties
      objective: "Ensure that an appropriate separation of duties is established for decisions that require the acquisition of both information system and supply chain components."
      recommendations:
        - "The separation of duties helps to ensure that adequate protections are in place for components entering the enterprise’s supply chain, such as denying developers the privilege to promote code that they wrote from development to production environments."
        - "Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors."

  title: Audit and Accountability
  description: "Audit and accountability controls for C-SCRM provide information that is useful in the event of a supply chain cybersecurity incident or compromise."
  guidelines:
    - id: AU-6
      title: Audit Record Review, Analysis, and Reporting
      objective: "Review, analyze, and report on system audit records for indications of inappropriate or unusual activity related to the supply chain."
      recommendations:
        - "The enterprise should ensure that both supply chain and information security auditable events are appropriately filtered and correlated for analysis and reporting."
        - "For example, if new maintenance or a patch upgrade is recognized to have an invalid digital signature, the identification of the patch arrival qualifies as a supply chain auditable event, while an invalid signature is an information security auditable event."
        - "The enterprise should adjust the level of audit record review based on the risk changes (e.g., active threat intel, risk profile) on a specific vendor."
        - "Contracts should explicitly address how audit findings will be reported and adjudicated."

  title: Planning
  description: "C-SCRM should influence security planning, including activities such as security architecture, coordination with other enterprise entities, and development of System Security Plans."
  guidelines:
    - id: PL-8
      title: Security and Privacy Architectures
      objective: "Define and direct the implementation of security and privacy-protection methods, mechanisms, and capabilities for underlying systems and networks."
      recommendations:
        - "Security architecture is fundamental to C-SCRM because it helps to ensure that security is built-in throughout the SDLC."
        - "Enterprises should consider implementing zero-trust architectures and should ensure that the security architecture is well understood by system developers/engineers and system security engineers."
        - "Supplier diversity provides options for addressing information security and supply chain concerns. The enterprise should incorporate this control as it relates to suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers."
        - "The enterprise should plan for the potential replacement of suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers in case one is no longer able to meet the enterprise’s requirements (e.g., company goes out of business or does not meet contractual obligations)."

  title: System and Services Acquisition
  description: "These controls address the activities of acquirers, suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, other ICT/OT-related service providers, and related upstream supply chain relationships."
  guidelines:
    - id: SA-15
      title: Development Process, Standards, and Tools
      objective: "Require a documented and formalized development process to guide internal and system integrator developers to mitigate cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain."
      recommendations:
        - "The enterprise should apply national and international standards and best practices when implementing this control. Using existing standards promotes consistency of implementation, reliable and defendable processes, and interoperability."
        - "The enterprise’s development, maintenance, test, and deployment environments should all be covered by this control."
        - "The use of automated tools aids thoroughness, efficiency, and the scale of analysis that helps address cybersecurity risks that arise in relation to the development process throughout the supply chain."

  title: Supply Chain Risk Management
  description: "A new control family established in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5, to address supply chain risks."
  guidelines:
    - id: SR-3
      title: Supply Chain Controls and Processes
      objective: "Establish processes to identify, assess, and respond to weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain elements and processes."
      recommendations:
        - "Enterprises should diversify their supply base, especially for critical ICT/OT products and services."
        - "As a part of this exercise, the enterprise should attempt to identify single points of failure and risk among primes and lower-level entities in the supply chain."
        - "Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors throughout the SDLC."
        - "As part of procurement requirements, enterprises should include the need for suppliers to flow down controls to subcontractors throughout the SDLC."
